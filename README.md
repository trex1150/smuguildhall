# smuguildhall
My portfolio for my SMU Guildhall application. Specific files of interest from the zipped directories are alternatively located in the non-zipped versions of their folders if you would like to bypass the entire project and look specifically at the code I wrote. The project titles are Tetris, Huffman, Trailblazer, and threadpool.

Edit: I also added a directory called bunnyworld that displays a game I created with a partner for a final project. I got an email from SMU saying my application deadline was extended, and felt it important to add this. I did this before 11:59 p.m. on February 16.
