Directory structure: The /src folder contains the desired file trailblazer.cpp. The /lib and /res folders contain different libraries and graphical resources for the project as a whole to function

Explanation/description: This project creates a graphical representation of the breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, A-Star, and Kruskal algorithms. The code I wrote is contained within trailblazier.cpp. This code demonstrates understanding of pointers and linked list in order to navigate graphs, as well as different search algorithms. The other files in the folder were created by Stanford faculty in order to visually demonstrate the algorithms' capabilities.
